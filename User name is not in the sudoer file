1. Open a Root Terminal and type visudo (to access and edit the list)
2. Navigate to the bottom of the sudoers file that is now displayed in the terminal.
Just under the line that looks like the following:
root ALL = (ALL) ALL
and the following (replacing user with your actual username such as Kevin)
user ALL=(ALL) ALL
Now save the file (by type wq then press Enter).
